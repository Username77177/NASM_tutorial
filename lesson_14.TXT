CALCULATOR - MULTIPLICATION

In this program we will be multiplying the value in the register EBX by the value in the register EAX. Firstly we
load EAX and EBX with integers in the same way as in lesson 12. The only difference is we will be using the MUL
instruction to perform our multiplication logic. The MUL instruction is different from many instructions in NASM in
that it only accepts one further argument. The MUL instruction always multiplies EAX by whatever value gets passed
to it and stores the result in EAX.
