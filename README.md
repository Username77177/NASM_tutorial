This project is aimed at people who want to learn the NASM x86 Assembler and have no prior experience with it.

It's best to start with reading the notes to about the middle, then you can either start the lessons, have a go at
programming with NASM yourself or continue reading the advanced notes.

I hope you find this tutorial interesting and educative.
