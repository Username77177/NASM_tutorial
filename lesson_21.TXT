TELLING THE TIME

Generating a unix timestamp in NASM is easy witht he SYS_TIME function of the linux kernel. Simply pass OPCOPDE 13
to the kernel with no arguments and you are returned the UNIX EPOCH in the EAX register.
That is the number of seconds that have elapsed since Jan, 1st 1970 UTC.

NOTE:	This is the last lesson in this tutorial, and as you might have noticed since lesson 19 there isn't much
	new, just repetition. I hope you had fun writing some NASM x86 and that my tutorial helped you on your way.
	If you're still thirsty for more there is the official NASM documentation and the kernel OPCODE list.
