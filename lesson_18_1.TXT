FIZZBUZZ WITH USER INPUT

In lesson 18 we've written a program that counts numbers until 100 and prints out "Fizz" when the number is
divisible by 3, "Buzz" when the number is divisible by 5, "FizzBuzz" when disible by both 3 and 5 or the number
itself if neither. Now we're going to change the code so that the user can determin how far the program should
count. To do this we will have to create a .bss section again, store an unitialized variable in there and write to
it at the start of the program.
