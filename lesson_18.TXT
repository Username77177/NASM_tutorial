FIZZBUZZ

If you've done some programming tutorials in the past you probably have heard about fizzbuzz. The gist of it is
simple: it's a game to teach kids division. You count from 1 to 100 replacing any number divisible by 3 with the
word "fizz" and any number divisible by 5 "buzz". Numbers that are both divisible by 3 and 5 are replaced by the
word "fizzbuzz". This childrens game has also become an interview screening question for programming jobs since you
can easily discover candidates who can't construct a simple logic gate.

There are a number of code solutions to this simple game and some languages offer very trivial and elegant
solutions. Depending on how you choose to solve it, the solution almost always involves an if statement and possibly
an else statement depending wether you choose to exploit the mathematical property that anything divisible by 3 & 5
would also be divisible by 3 * 5. Being that this is an assembly language tutorial we will provide a solution that
involves a structure of two cascading if statements to print the words "fizz" and/or "buzz" and an else statement
in case these fail, to print the integer as an ASCII value. Each itereation of our loop will then print a line feed.
Once we reach 100 we call our program exit function.
