SUBROUTINES

Subroutines are functions. They are reusable pieces of code that can be called by your program to perform
various repeatable tasks. Subroutines are declared using labels just like we've used before (eg. _start:),
however we don't use the JMP instruction to get to them - instead we use a new instruction CALL.
